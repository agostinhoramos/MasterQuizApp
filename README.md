# Master Quiz App
## Quiz: Conflict in Ukraine <img src="https://images.emojiterra.com/google/noto-emoji/v2.028/128px/1f1fa-1f1e6.png" width="23px" height="23px">

The evolution of today's mobile devices increases the number of mobile applications developed and among them the quiz applications. Android Mobile hardware and software platforms allow the running of faster and richer applications.

We're currently experiencing a huge tension between Ukraine and Russia, as a way of honoring these hardworking people, I decided to create a multiple choice application with the questions that many of us ask each other.

- Why is Russia invading Ukraine?
- What does Putin want?
- What is the next country after Ukraine?
- Why are there so few wars in the 21st century?<br/>
...

This application is developed for educational purposes in my Master's in Mobile Computing at IPG which was proposed to me to develop an application in Android Studio using the Kotlin Programming Language.

In this github repository, you can see step by step the development of a quiz application from scratch using Android Studio. This work deals with the development of an Android-based multiple-choice question examination system, namely: Master Quiz App.
